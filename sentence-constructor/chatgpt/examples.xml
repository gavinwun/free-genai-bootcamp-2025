    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because student need to figure that out.
    - GOOD: The sentence structure is good because it is conceptual

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work through it together. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:
    |   Japanese  |     Romaji      |   English     |   Parts of Speech |
    |-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
    |   くま    |   kuma    |   bear    |   Noun    |
    |   ドア    |   doa     |   door    |   Noun    |
    |   ごみ    |   gomi    |   garbage |   Noun    |
    |   のこす  |   nokosu  |   leave   |   Verb    |
    |   いる    |   iru     |   be      |   Verb    |
    Possible Particles:
    |   Particle   |  Romaji  |  English Equivalent  |
    |--------------|----------|----------------------|
    |   に  |   ni  |   at, to  |
    |   を  |   o   |   direct object   |
    |   が  |   ga  |   subject marker  |
    |   は  |   wa  |   topic marker    |
    |   で  |   de  |   at, with    |
    A possible sentence structure for the two clauses could be:
    Clause 1: [Noun] + [Particle] + [Location] + [Verb]
    Clause 2: [Polite Prefix] + [Verb] + [Particle] + [Location] + [Question Marker]
    Now, let's think about the first clause:
    What particle would you use to indicate the location of the bears at the door?
    For the second clause:
    What polite prefix would you add to the verb (のこす) to make it polite?
    Think about how you would ask a question politely in Japanese!
    (Remember, I'll guide you through it, but I won't give away the final answer!)
