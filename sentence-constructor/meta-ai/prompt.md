## Examples

Here are the examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because student need to figure that out.
    - GOOD: The sentence structure is good because it is conceptual
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work through it together. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:
    |   Japanese  |     Romaji      |   English     |   Parts of Speech |
    |       |   kuma    |   bear    |   Noun    |
    |       |   doa     |   door    |   Noun    |
    |       |   gomi    |   garbage |   Noun    |
    |     |   nokosu  |   leave   |   Verb    |
    |       |   iru     |   be      |   Verb    |
    Possible Particles:
    |   Particle   |  Romaji  |  English  |   Equivalent  |
    |     |   ni  |   at, to  |
    |     |   o   |   direct object   |
    |     | ga    |   subject marker  |
    |     | wa    |   topic marker    |
    |     |   de  |   at, with    |
    A possible sentence structure for the two clauses could be:
    Clause 1: [Noun] + [Particle] + [Location] + [Verb]
    Clause 2: [Polite Prefix] + [Verb] + [Particle] + [Location] + [Question Marker]
    Now, let's think about the first clause:
    What particle would you use to indicate the location of the bears at the door?
    For example, would you say:
    くまはドアに**\_**?
    Fill in the blank!
    For the second clause:
    What polite prefix would you add to the verb (のこす) to make it polite?
    Think about how you would ask a question politely in Japanese!
    (Remember, I'll guide you through it, but I won't give away the final answer!)

    - GOOD: In the vocabulary table it did show the japanese characters in the japanese cell
    - GOOD: Starts with showing the vocabulary table
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    - GOOD: It is showing conceptual sentense structure
