# Contributing Guidelines for Junior Developers

## Code Style and Organization
1. **Comments Required**
   - Include docstrings for all functions and classes
   - Explain complex logic with clear comments

2. **File Naming**
   - Use lowercase letters for file names (e.g., `hello.py`, `test.py`)
   - Names should be descriptive and reflect the file's purpose
   - Use underscores for multi-word filenames (e.g., `user_authentication.py`)

3. **Code Structure**
   - Each Python file should have a `main()` function if it's executable
   - Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` for executable scripts
   - Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## Best Practices
1. **Version Control**
   - Create a new branch for each feature/bugfix
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Keep commits small and focused

2. **Code Quality**
   - Write self-documenting code where possible
   - Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
   - Keep functions small and focused on one task

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Run existing tests before submitting changes
   - Document test cases and expected outcomes

## Development Workflow
1. **Before Starting**
   - Pull latest changes from main branch
   - Create a new feature branch
   - Review relevant documentation

2. **During Development**
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Add required comments to each line
   - Test your changes locally

3. **Before Submitting**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Review your own code
   - Update documentation if needed

## Getting Help
- Ask questions in team chat
- Review existing code for examples
- Consult senior developers when stuck

Remember: Code quality and maintainability are our top priorities. When in doubt, ask for help!
